/*
1. a. AngularJS lets you extend HTML with new attributes called Directives.
	  AngularJS directives are extended HTML attributes with the prefix ng-.
   Ex:
	The ng-app directive initializes an AngularJS application.

	The ng-init directive initializes application data.

	The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.
	
   b. At a high level, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. 	via event listeners), or even to transform the DOM element and its children.	

2. Here we are injecting barChart module ( using morris.js) into our application.

3. The $http service is a core Angular service that facilitates communication with the remote HTTP servers via the browser's XMLHttpRequest object or via JSONP.

4. Scope is the glue between application controller and the view. During the template linking phase the directives set up $watch expressions on the scope. The $watch allows the directives to be notified of property changes, which allows the directive to render the updated value to the DOM.

 1. In Angular, a Controller is defined by a JavaScript constructor function that is used to augment the Angular Scope.
	When a Controller is attached to the DOM via the ng-controller directive, Angular will instantiate a new Controller object, using the specified Controller's constructor function. A new child scope will be created and made available as an injectable parameter to the Controller's constructor function as $scope.

 2. AngularJS controllers control the data of AngularJS applications.
	AngularJS controllers are regular JavaScript Objects.
	The ng-controller directive defines the application controller.
